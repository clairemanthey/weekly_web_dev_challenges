## Introduction
I put this project together from [The Weekly Web Dev Challenge ](https://scrimba.com/learn/weeklychallenge). I began with completing each challenge and then compiling them into a single web application, categorizing them by which ones were design based challenges, responsive challenges, and challenges that required Javascript. 

## Motivation
I started these challenges to stretch my HTML, CSS, and JavsScript skills, as well as work on a deadline to get each challenge done.

## Built With
